    title: "Love Song",
    singer: "なとり / natori",
    description: `The song "ラブソング (Love Song)" by なとり (natori) explores the complexities and uncertainties of love. The lyrics convey a sense of confusion and longing, as the narrator reflects on their experiences with love and contemplates their desires and self-worth.
    The narrator questions the number of times they have experienced love, feeling lost and deeply immersed in their emotions. They acknowledge their own selfishness and express a desire to break themselves down for their own sake. This could indicate a willingness to sacrifice their own well-being for the sake of love, even if it means enduring pain and vulnerability.
    The imagery of rain dancing on soft skin and the grey color of the outcome imply a somber and ordinary ending to love, as if love is a common occurrence that eventually loses its luster. The lyrics also suggest that within the routines of everyday life, there are hidden desires and a longing to express oneself, symbolized by the smoke that rises within each person's life.
    In the second verse, the narrator has dreams and memories that they struggle to forget, suggesting an unwillingness to let go of past experiences. They hide their true selves behind lies and await the arrival of someone, possibly a loved one, remaining devoted despite everything feeling different.
    The lyrics also touch on the theme of forgiveness. The narrator desires nothing but forgiveness and acceptance, indicating a longing for reciprocated love. They acknowledge the scars and flawed answers that arise from hurting one another, comparing them to rain falling on the windowsill. Despite their own self-perceived imperfections, the narrator is willing to embrace them if it means being loved in return.
    Ultimately, the song expresses a deep longing for a singular love that is fully remembered and cherished. The repetition of "ただ、あなただけ (Just, only you)" emphasizes the desire for an exclusively devoted love, regardless of past mistakes and uncertainties. The closing lines express the desire to be "broken" and "killed" for the sake of the narrator's own growth and self-discovery, signifying a willingness to go to extreme lengths to find love and meaning in their existence.`,

    title: "Sleepwalk",
    singer: "なとり / natori",
    description: `The song "Sleepwalk" by なとり (natori) explores the feeling of being trapped in a monotonous and unfulfilling routine. The lyrics suggest that the protagonist is experiencing a series of repetitive nights, where nothing really exciting or significant happens. They describe this state as something that could easily put them into a deep sleep if they were to fully understand its nature or purpose.
    The song also touches upon the theme of imbalance between imagination and reality. The protagonist feels overwhelmed by the discrepancy between their fantasies and the harsh truth of their circumstances. They express frustration at the superficial and disposable nature of communication, often being deceived by others who use cheap, plastic-like words to easily manipulate them.
    There is a sense of dissatisfaction and unhappiness throughout the lyrics. The protagonist admits to feeling constantly unhappy without realizing it, highlighting the negative impact of their everyday life. The fear of being discovered by others and experiencing a bad ending adds to their anxiety. Despite this, they emphasize that they are still sleepwalking, implying that they are going through the motions without fully engaging or finding a way out of their predicament.
    The chorus suggests the dejected state of the protagonist's existence. They feel trapped and unable to escape their situation, acknowledging that they have become accustomed to the unhappiness that accompanies each day. However, there seems to be a newfound realization that change is needed, as they express a desire for someone important to stay by their side and not leave them behind. This revelation leads to a greater understanding of their current circumstances.
    In the final lines, the song repeats the phrase "Sleepwalk" as a reminder of the ongoing state of stagnation and disconnection. The protagonist conveys a sense of resignation, acknowledging the difficulty of breaking free from their sleepwalking state and the urgency of waking up from their dreams.
    Overall, "Sleepwalk" portrays a feeling of being trapped in a mundane and unfulfilling routine while highlighting the importance of self-awareness and making changes to escape this cycle of unhappiness.`,

    image: sarushibai,
    title: "Sarushibai",
    singer: "なとり / natori",
    description: `In "なとり (Natori) - 猿芝居 (Sarushibai)," also known as "Monkey Show," Genius English Translations presents us with a deeply introspective and thought-provoking analysis of human existence and relationships. By delving into themes of longing, disillusionment, and the complexities of love, the song offers a profound commentary on the nature of life itself.
    The first verse immediately sets the tone for introspection, suggesting the desire to escape from the current world and venture into a different existence. However, it also highlights a sense of mistrust and weariness towards others, suggesting a weather-beaten soul that has experienced its fair share of disappointment. This juxtaposition of emotions creates a bittersweet irony that permeates throughout the song.
    The lines "Not even making the slightest movement / At any rate, I've got no time to lose" reveal a sense of stagnation and urgency. It conveys the narrator's realization that time is fleeting and they are unwilling to waste any more of it. This sentiment is further emphasized in the subsequent lines, where brief moments of connection have fleeting prominence, urging the listener to cherish and appreciate such moments.
    The chorus draws attention to the performative aspect of life. The invitation to play and be played suggests a desire to be swept away by the applause, perhaps seeking validation or a sense of purpose. The allusions to atrocity, boisterousness, and fastidiousness when there seems to be no destination underline the inherent hollowness of this pursuit. The night, a symbol of darkness and uncertainty, further amplifies the tumultuous nature of the world.
    The second verse explores the concept of imagination and its potential to transport us to a better place. The distance of 3,000 miles serves as both a physical and metaphorical representation of a different world. However, doubt and impatience plague the narrator, hindering their ability to fully embrace their own imaginings. This incapacity is further emphasized by the allusion to grief and pleasure consuming their daily life, leaving little room for genuine fulfillment.
    The notion of rivalry in love also surfaces in this verse, with the narrator questioning whether another individual they have encountered could be a competitor for affection. This addition amplifies the internal conflicts and uncertainties the narrator faces, highlighting their perpetual restlessness.
    The pre-chorus introduces the idea of two individuals unable to blend harmoniously. It suggests that in a disordered world, allowing oneself to be influenced by external chaos inhibits genuine connection. The choice to say goodbye momentarily implies a hopeful reunion in an unknown city, hinting at the potential for personal growth and self-discovery away from familiar surroundings.
    The second chorus dives deeper into the realm of love. The performance aspect remains present as the narrator describes love as captivating and heart-winning. The delicate metaphor of flower petals gently falling alludes to the transient nature of relationships. The question posed about the person's honesty further reflects the narrator's skepticism and their struggle to fully trust others.
    The guitar solo serves as a melodic interlude, allowing the listener to absorb the emotional intensity of the preceding verses and chorus. It enhances the introspective quality of the song, enabling emotions to resonate and flourish.
    The final chorus brings the themes of the song to a crescendo. The invitation to drink it all until the end, until it's finished, signifies an acceptance of the temporary nature of existence. The narrator acknowledges the inevitability of solitude, reinforcing the idea that in the end, we are alone in this world. The self-reflection culminates in a sense of shame and an eternal goodbye, emphasizing the consequences of the narrator's search for connection.
    Ultimately, "Monkey Show" encapsulates the intricate and sometimes contradictory aspects of human existence. It deeply explores themes of longing, disillusionment, and the elusive nature of love. The song invites listeners to reflect on their own desires for connection, the performative aspects of life, and the pursuit of authenticity in the face of a chaotic world.`,

The refrain suggests that the narrator is not looking for a typical and cheesy love song, instead, they desire a raw and imperfect love that can bring some fulfillment and passion to their life.
    The chorus expresses the idea that the narrator is clinging to something that is not worth holding onto. They acknowledge that this love affair is not meaningful, but they do not want to let go. The post-chorus explores the conflicting emotions of the narrator who is unsure if they are living in a dream or reality. By the end of the song, the narrator urges themselves to forget about this meaningless love and move on. The outro repeats the chorus, indicating that the narrator has fully come to terms with ending the relationship.

    The bridge highlights the beauty and preciousness of faint footstep echoes, swaying curtains, and exposed eyes. Each of these details awaits something, and at the end of that line, the protagonist is waiting for someone.
    The breakdown echoes the sentiments of the chorus, emphasizing the protagonist's desire to disappear into the night and their realization that they can only doubt everything they hear.
    The final chorus expresses the protagonist's desire to stay and breathe in the present moment, even if they are mocked for their arrogance. They acknowledge that the words they hear are harsh and clear, but they choose to embrace their own path, even if it seems like a straight maze.
    The outro restates the question of who is to blame for the pain of emptiness, and the singer concludes that they are the only one afraid of being right, signifying the fear of standing out or going against societal norms.
    Overall, "Cult." delves into the struggles of youth, the feelings of emptiness, and the desire to find one's own path in a conformist world.`,

They describe a sad and pitiful young boy who is overwhelmed by the chaos and destruction around him, symbolized by wildfires. The song criticizes those who act fake and pretentious, using the term "センチ" (sentimental) to describe their false actions.
    The chorus, "さぁ、真っ白いテーブルを囲んで 踊れ、回る皿の上で 僕ら、正しい呼吸も忘れて 溺れていくまでがオチさ 贅沢な食卓を" (Come, gather around the pure white table, Dance on the spinning dishes, Forget the correct breathing, Until we drown, that's the punchline, A luxurious dining table), suggests a metaphorical representation of a dining table where people are expected to conform and dance according to society's expectations. The focus shifts to criticism of hypocrites and the noise of the outside world, while also acknowledging that society doesn't accept complaints.
    The lyrics further emphasize the idea of individuals being labeled as "クズ" (trash) or "馬鹿" (fool) according to society's rules and norms. The song suggests that society doesn't tolerate complaints and insists on conformity. The lyrics also imply that people should dance on the palm of that oppressive hand.
    The bridge, "もう、酸いも甘いもご勝手にどうぞ 不確かにずっと、飼っていた毒を この、細胞を踊らせてくれよ その、尖りきった言葉で！" (Now, have the sour and sweet freely, The poison that I've kept uncertainly all along, Let it make my cells dance, With those sharp words!), suggests a desire to break free from the societal constraints.

    The song concludes with the repetition of the chorus, emphasizing the struggle to find genuine love and connection amidst a superficial and materialistic world, symbolized by the "贅沢な食卓" (luxurious dining table). The final lines, "もう、真っ黒いエレジィを掻き鳴らせ 踊ろうぜ、手のひらの上で！ お前らが馬鹿にした、餌どもに 喰われていく気分はどうだい？" (Now, let the dark elegy resound, Let's dance on the palm of your hand!
